A web application where it collects and displays top news articles from various resources by categories (ex: Business, Entertainment), Terms (ex : Bitcoin, Smartphones) and also by sources (ex: CNN, BBC News). Navigation is enabled through a incredible voice assistant

## Do not Install:

This project is not for public use. It just a read-only project for others to look up on how to integrate the voice-assistant in a React web application.

## Tech Stack Used:

* ReactJs
* Material-Ui
* Alan-Ai

## How to use it :

Once the webapp is opened, click the alan-button at bottom right corner of the page. Once clicked, it will ask you what to do. You need to grant audio permissions to the site for commmunicating.
There are few examples mentioned on how to communicate with it on the page. You can start by saying like "Give me the news from CNN" or "give me the latest technology news".
Then it will display the top articles with beautiful cards arranged in a responsive grid. It will ask you for permission to read the articles for you. Like this, one can navigate through pages through
the voice assistant. 

## Bugs :

A few bugs are present. I will try to clear them over time.
